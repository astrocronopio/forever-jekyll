* Bachelor & Master in Physics at Instituto Balseiro, Argentina. I studied ultra high energy cosmic rays at the Pierre Auger Observatory, and some other weird particules in the Photonic & Optomechanics Laboratory, Bariloche Atomic Center.

* I worked for 6 months as Data Scientist in the DESY ATLAS Group in Hamburg, Germany, in collaboration with Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Jülich Supercomputing Centre, applying Machine Learning approaches to Particle Physics. I studied Deep Graphs NN VAEs modeling energy readings inside the ATLAS Experiment.

* Also I was part of the tutorial classes of Introduction to Machine Learning for Physicists in Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin during the winter term 2021-2022. 

* I play many games, mostly RPG PC games.
