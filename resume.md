## Physicist:
I like implementing smart solutions to every task I encounter. I have 2+ years of experience in Machine Learning in industry and scientific research. My physicist background helps me to understand mathematics behind algorithms and data analysis, and my experience provides me with strong programming skills for Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence.


## Experience

### Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron -- Data Scientist 
> Hamburg, Germany -- September 2021 - March 2022
   
I learned about the state-of-the-art Deep Graphs Convolutional Neural Networks papers in physics and explored and experimented with repositories on the topic using PyTorch Geometrical. Advisor: Prof. Dr Judith Katzy

### Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin  -- Student Tutor              
> Hamburg, Germany --  October 2021 - February 2022
   
Tutorial classes for Einführung in Maschinelles Lernen für Physiker for the winter term 2021-2022. I helped the students in getting a detailed introduction to Tensorflow and classical Machine Learning.

### Cortical.com, Inc. -- Machine Learning Consultant                  
> San Francisco, CA -- December 2020 - July 2021
   
Remote Work. Focus on Reinforcement Learning & Bayesian Learning. I developed algorithms and helped to debug existing codes with C++ and CUDA. 

### The Pierre Auger Observatory -- Student Intern                    

> Bariloche, Argentina -- August 2019 - February 2021
   
During my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, I performed data analysis on measurements of ultra high energy cosmic rays, finding anomalies in a large dataset suggesting a possible dipole in an interesting energy range, using ROOT, C++ and Python. Advisor:  Prof. Dr Silvia Mollerach

### Cortical.com, Inc. -- Remote Internship                     
> San Francisco, CA -- April 2020 - June 2020
   
I learned to approach different problems with a more pragmatic point of view, beyond the mathematical models with unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques using C++.
