<blockquote>
  <p>Bariloche, Argentina â€“ August 2019 - February 2021</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees, I performed data analysis on measurements of ultra high energy cosmic rays, finding anomalies in a large dataset suggesting a possible dipole in an interesting energy range, using ROOT, C++ and Python. Advisor:  Prof. Dr Silvia Mollerach</p>

<h3 id="corticalcom-inc--remote-internship">Cortical.com, Inc. â€“ Remote Internship</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>San Francisco, CA â€“ April 2020 - June 2020</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I learned to approach different problems with a more pragmatic point of view, beyond the mathematical models with unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques using C++.</p>
